    <h2>Welcome to Boss Rush</h2>
    <p><strong>Boss Rush</strong> is a fast-paced survival game where you take on an endless wave of bosses, each more powerful than the last. The objective is simple: survive, defeat, and repeat.</p>

    <h3>Game Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Boss Variety:</strong> Face multiple unique superbosses, each with different behaviors and abilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Scaling Difficulty:</strong> Every boss becomes tougher with each respawn, increasing in both health and resistance.</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic Combat:</strong> Learn to dodge, shoot, and counter enemy patterns to stay alive.</li>
      <li><strong>Smooth Controls:</strong> Use the arrow keys to move and spacebar to shoot — simple yet challenging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visual Interface</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Health Bars:</strong> Both you and the boss have visible health bars. Stay alive and track your damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Score Panel:</strong> Keep track of how many bosses you’ve defeated in the top-left corner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Makes Boss Rush Different?</h3>
    <p>Unlike typical enemy spam games, Boss Rush is built around <em>smart design</em> — every boss is handcrafted with unique traits and escalating mechanics. Victory requires pattern recognition, sharp reflexes, and strategy.</p>
