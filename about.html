    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arrow Keys:</strong> Move your player</li>
      <li><strong>Spacebar:</strong> Shoot</li>
      <li><strong>Enter:</strong> Restart after defeat</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Superbosses</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Teleporter:</strong> Warps across the screen, making it hard to predict. <em>Tip:</em> Time your shots when it reappears.</li>
      <li><strong>The Speedster:</strong> Extremely fast movement. <em>Tip:</em> Keep your distance and fire continuously.</li>
      <li><strong>The Twins:</strong> Two bosses at once with independent movement. <em>Tip:</em> Focus on one first to reduce pressure.</li>
      <li><strong>The Titan:</strong> Slower but is massive and can more easily corner you. <em>Tip:</em> Keep moving and chip away at its health.</li>
      <li><strong>The Shield-Bearer:</strong> Has a shield that rotates counter-clockwise, blocking shots and reflecting them back at you. <em>Tip:</em> Shoot from the exposed side when the shield rotates.</li>
      <li><strong>The Gunner:</strong> Shoots back at you. <em>Tip:</em> Use corners to dodge and peek to shoot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay mobile â€” never let a boss corner you.</li>
      <li>Observe attack patterns before engaging aggressively.</li>
      <li>Use boss knockback after damage to create space.</li>
    </ul>
